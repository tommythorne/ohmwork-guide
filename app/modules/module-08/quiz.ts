    answer: "B",
    why: "Remove abandoned cable; it adds fuel load and violates plenum rules."

      { key: "C", text: "Select a higher rating (e.g., CMP in a riser)" },
      { key: "D", text: "Ask AHJ to decide on site" }
    ],
    answer: "C",
    why: "Higher ratings are acceptable in lower-risk spaces; never step down."
